    This is a rundown of an app that combined food delivery and a live cooking show.


    The app will allow users to order food from a list of restaurants. 
    The app will also allow users to interact with a live cooking show.
    Within the cooking show, users can add tips and send messages to the chef.
    Live orders are diplayed publically so all users can see what others are ordering.
    There will be a priority queue for the chef to see what orders to cook first, based on the time the order was placed and the amount of tips the user has sent.
